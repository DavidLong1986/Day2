    <h2>About me…</h2>
    <p>This business is an extension and in honor of someone who was my greatest inspiration, my mom. She has influenced everything when it comes to all things “kitchen”; from how I set up my cupboards in my house the day I moved out, to the ever growing passion I have for food and preparing it for others. There is no greater compliment than seeing someone’s face light up and turn into a smile after just one bite and my goal is to be able to do just that.</p>
    <p>My mom always kicked it up a notch with everything she made as the end result was always perfection and that is what I strive for. I don’t think I’ll ever be the amazing cook that my mother was, however I’m happy just to be able to recreate some of her amazing recipes, as well as a few more I’ve picked up along the way; after all I had a great teacher.</p>
     <p>I only use the best and freshest products in everything I make, including the one and only Callebaut chocolate. My passion for making everything homemade drives me to want to bring a little bit of my home into yours. With only using high quality ingredients and a dash of love, I will keep your taste buds and tummies asking for more.</p>
